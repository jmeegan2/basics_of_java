/*
Overall features
1. strongly typed
2. compile once, run anywhere
3. top-level object class
4. all objects are references (to an object instance)
5. garbage collection
6. single inheritance
7. multi-threaded
8. exception handling

Strongly typed
* Every variable must be declared with a data type and it must stay as that type

Classes
* Implementation of an abstract data type, cannot access the class unless its declared as public instead of private.
    regular classes are declared public. There are other classes (e.g., inner classes) that are private.

Data type
* A data type is a set of values and a set of operators that operate on those values

for example, the integer (primitive data) type:
(1) set of integer value

Abstract Data type
* Programmer defined type is a new data type constructed

Common methods of a class
* Constructors
* Getters
* Operations

Encapsulation
* Provides a form of data hiding in OOP, in which class members can be hidden (declared private) and other made
    accessible (declared public)
* Instance variables are declared private, and methods declared public

Special Method toString
* Inherited from top-level object class. Produces an object's value as string
    .toString

Static members of a class
* There is only one instance of a static class for all objects of that class
